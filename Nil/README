In this folder you can find the code, plots and geopandas for studying the number of visits that a police office has (in order to file a complaint) and the waiting time between entering the building to file the complaint and being attended. 
The data analyzed is from 2011 to 2021, updated monthly. For the whole group analysis the data analyzed has been restricted to 2020 and 2021.


The code 'code_data.py' is written in Python (version 3.8.5) and allow us to process the data and obtain the plots.

The libraries used:
  
    numpy >  1.23.4

    matplotlib > 3.6.2

    pandas > 1.5.1

    geopandas >  0.12.1

The dataset used in this study has been collected by Dades Obertes de Catalunya. The source: https://analisi.transparenciacatalunya.cat/Seguretat/Temps-d-espera-per-interposar-den-ncia-a-depend-nc/qxev-y8x7

From the source https://www.icgc.cat/Administracio-i-empresa/Descarregues/Capes-de-geoinformacio/Mapes-municipals we obtain the files to plot the 'municipis' and 'comarques' in Catalonia. These has been processed by my colleague Robert in order to only have the 9 'Regions Policials' (RP) that are in Catalonia.
These files are necessary in order to plot the maps:
