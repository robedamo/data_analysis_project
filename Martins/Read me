  -"daily_patrols_project.py": python code that contains the last version used in order to obtain the results 
  
  -"hello_word.py": python code that has been modified in order to achieve the last version


Plots:

  -"dailypatrolsRP.png": bar plot of the daily patrols per RP (blue) with a line (red) that represents the total mean of daily patrols
  
  -"map_area.png": map of Catalonia divided by RP that represents logarithm of the number of daily patrols per RP per area in km^2
  
  -"map_mean_daily_patrols.png": map of Catalonia divided by RP that represents the daily patrols per RP
  
  -"map_popu.png": map of Catalonia divided by RP that represents the daily patrols per 100.000 inhabitants per RP
